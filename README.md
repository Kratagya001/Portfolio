# Portfolio

I’m a driven and curious learner with a passion for technology, space, and artificial intelligence. With a deep interest in emerging fields like neuromorphic computing, brain-computer interfaces, and the synergy between AI and space, I’m currently building a strong foundation in computer science and mathematics.

I’m pursuing a self-directed learning path focused on mastering AI, programming (especially Python), and foundational computing principles beyond traditional academics. Alongside this, I’m preparing for competitive exams and developing a mindset shaped by mental models, first-principles thinking, and systems design.

As a future tech entrepreneur, I’m laying the groundwork for launching a startup in the technology and space sector. I believe in disciplined learning, early action, and designing solutions that push boundaries and create meaningful impact.
